# TrafficForecasting-PhDResearch
Repository for my PhD thesis on Traffic Forecasting

This repository contains the research work and materials associated with my PhD thesis on Traffic Forecasting. It includes a comprehensive collection of datasets, code, models, and documentation developed during my doctoral studies. The focus of this research is on applying deep-learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of traffic flow prediction models. 

Key Highlights:
- In-depth analysis of traffic data to uncover spatial, temporal, and periodic patterns.
- Development and implementation of innovative traffic forecasting models, including hybrid deep learning approaches.
- Application of novel methodologies for feature selection and model evaluation in traffic forecasting.
- Extensive documentation and guidelines for replicating the research and further exploration.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals interested in traffic forecasting and deep learning applications in transportation. It reflects my commitment to open science and the collaborative advancement of knowledge in the field of traffic management and forecasting.
